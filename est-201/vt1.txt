Remember:

This assignment encourages you to think critically about technological forecasting and its role in shaping our future. 10 Slides with Narration and/or Video of Yourself minimum for entire assignment. Please do not send me the topic for approval, that isn't necessary. Just write about something you are interested in and research it. You must have one slide that provides an APA citation of references. You must also state how those resources were accessed. I suggest using the library resources available to students. If you select a resource that I cannot access freely or through the university databases you will lose 50 points.
